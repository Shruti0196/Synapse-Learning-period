For example, {“a”, “about”, “above”, “across”, “after”, “afterward”, “again”, ...} can be considered as stop words. Traditionally, we could remove all of them in the text preprocessing stage. However, refer to the example from the [Natural Language Processing in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/natural-language-processing-in-action) book: \n","> * Mark reported to the CEO\n","> * Suzanne reported as the CEO to the board \n","\n","> In your NLP pipeline, you might create 4-grams such as reported to the CEO and reported as the CEO. If you remove the stop words from the 4-grams, both examples would be reduced to \"reported CEO\", and you would lack the information about the professional hierarchy. In the first example, Mark could have been an assistant to the CEO, whereas in the second example Suzanne was the CEO reporting to the board. Unfortunately, retaining the stop words within your pipeline creates another problem: it increases the length of the n-grams required to make use of these connections formed by the otherwise meaningless stop words. This issue forces us to retain at least 4-grams if you want to avoid the ambiguity of the human resources example.\n","> Designing a filter for stop words depends on your particular application.\n","\n","In short, removing stop words is a common method in NLP text preprocessing, whereas, it needs to be experimented carefully depending on different situations. \n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2021-11-13T10:20:41.113323Z","iopub.status.busy":"2021-11-13T10:20:41.113005Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-11-13T10:20:41.155762Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-11-13T10:20:41.155096Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-11-13T10:20:41.113297Z"},"id":"_hEI07iBWGYa","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1637590119676,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":426,"user":{"displayName":"Shruti Prasad","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"00085333802018642516"}},"outputId":"7a6591df-3475-4965-bba5-6ef9fb14b82e","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":327}},"source":["# Remove stopwords from train_df['tokenized'] and save it in another column called 'stopwords_removed'\n","# Hint: Use pandas apply function with lambda function (the way we did in previous cells) and you can use list\n","# comprehension to remove stop words\n","\n","nltk.download(\"stopwords\")\n","from nltk.corpus import stopwords\n","\n","stop = set(stopwords.words('english'))\n","def stopwords_remove(text):\n","  text=[i for i in text if i not in stop]\n","  return text\n","    \n","#complete code below\n","train_df[\"stopwords_removed\"]=train_df[\"tokenized\"].apply(lambda x:stopwords_remove(x))\n","\n","\n","\n","train_df.head()"],"execution_count":76,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["[nltk_data] Downloading package stopwords to /root/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Package stopwords is already up-to-date!\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>id</th>\n","      <th>keyword</th>\n","      <th>location</th>\n","      <th>text</th>\n","      <th>target</th>\n","      <th>text_clean</th>\n","      <th>tokenized</th>\n","      <th>stopwords_removed</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>Our Deeds are the Reason of this #earthquake M...</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>our deeds are the reason of this earthquake ma...</td>\n","      <td>[our, deeds, are, the, reason, of, this, earth...</td>\n","      <td>[deeds, reason, earthquake, may, allah, forgiv...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>4</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>Forest fire near La Ronge Sask.

Stemming uproots suffixes from words to merge words with similar meanings under their standard stem.\n","\n","There are three major stemming algorithms in use nowadays:\n","- **Porter** - PorterStemmer()): This stemming algorithm is an older one. It’s from the 1980s and its main concern is removing the common endings to words so that they can be resolved to a common form. It’s not too complex and development on it is frozen. Typically, it’s a nice starting basic stemmer, but it’s not really advised to use it for any production/complex application. Instead, it has its place in research as a nice, basic stemming algorithm that can guarantee reproducibility. It also is a very gentle stemming algorithm when compared to others.\n","\n","- **Snowball** -  SnowballStemmer(): This algorithm is also known as the Porter2 stemming algorithm. It is almost universally accepted as better than the Porter stemmer, even being acknowledged as such by the individual who created the Porter stemmer. That being said, it is also more aggressive than the Porter stemmer. A lot of the things added to the Snowball stemmer were because of issues noticed with the Porter stemmer. There is about a 5% difference in the way that Snowball stems versus Porter.\n","\n","- **Lancaster** -LancasterStemmer(): Just for fun, the Lancaster stemming algorithm is another algorithm that you can use. This one is the most aggressive stemming algorithm of the bunch. However, if you use the stemmer in NLTK, you can add your own custom rules to this algorithm very easily. It’s a good choice for that. One complaint around this stemming algorithm though is that it sometimes is overly aggressive and can really transform words into strange stems. Just make sure it does what you want it to before you go with this option!\n","\n","source: http://hunterheidenreich.com/blog/stemming-lemmatization-what/\n","\n","### PorterStemmer"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2021-11-13T10:20:41.157015Z","iopub.status.busy":"2021-11-13T10:20:41.156792Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-11-13T10:20:41.162619Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-11-13T10:20:41.161640Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-11-13T10:20:41.156991Z"},"scrolled":true,"id":"AId_0JMlWGYb","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1637590121175,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1502,"user":{"displayName":"Shruti Prasad","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"00085333802018642516"}},"outputId":"adabe933-2962-4ce1-e153-d35fd238b603","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":362}},"source":["from nltk.stem.porter import PorterStemmer\n","\n","porter_stem=PorterStemmer()\n","def porter_stemmer(text):\n","    stemmed_text = [porter_stem.stem(word) for word in text]\n","    return stemmed_text\n","    \n","\n","\n","train_df['porter_stemmer'] = train_df['stopwords_removed'].apply(lambda x: porter_stemmer(x))\n","train_df.head()"],"execution_count":77,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>id</th>\n","      <th>keyword</th>\n","      <th>location</th>\n","      <th>text</th>\n","      <th>target</th>\n","      <th>text_clean</th>\n","      <th>tokenized</th>\n","      <th>stopwords_removed</th>\n","      <th>porter_stemmer</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>Our Deeds are the Reason of this #earthquake M...</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>our deeds are the reason of this earthquake ma...</td>\n","      <td>[our, deeds, are, the, reason, of, this, earth...</td>\n","      <td>[deeds, reason, earthquake, may, allah, forgiv...</td>\n","      <td>[deed, reason, earthquak, may, allah, forgiv, us]</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>4</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>Forest fire near La Ronge Sask.

The words am, are, and is have the shared lemma be; the words dinner and dinners both have the lemma dinner. Lemmatizing each of these forms to the same lemma will let us ﬁnd all mentions of words in Russian like Moscow. The lemmatized form of a sentence like He is reading detective stories would thus be He be read detective story.\n","\n","and the book [Natural Language Processing in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/natural-language-processing-in-action):\n","> Some lemmatizers use the word’s part of speech (POS) tag in addition to its spelling to help improve accuracy. The POS tag for a word indicates its role in the grammar of a phrase or sentence. For example, the noun POS is for words that refer to “people, places, or things” within a phrase. An adjective POS is for a word that modifies or describes a noun. A verb refers to an action. The POS of a word in isolation cannot be determined. The context of a word must be known for its POS to be identified. So some advanced lemmatizers can’t be run-on words in isolation.\n","\n","For example, the \"good\", \"better\" or \"best\" is lemmatized into good and the verb \"gardening\" should be lemmatized to \"to garden\", while the \"garden\" and \"gardener\" are both different lemmas.

However, the vectors corresponding to these words are orthogonal in the bag-of-words model. This issue presents a serious problem to understanding sentences within the model. The other problem in the bag-of-word is that the order of words in the phrase is not respected. The n-gram does not solve this problem so a similarity needs to be found for each word in the sentence.
